### 🍄 About Raoul 

Hi, my name is junior backend developer and I'm a Raoul.
Wait,... No no, the other way around. 
My name is Raoul and I'm a junior backend developer.
That's more like it!

I started my journey in IT with BeCode with the aspiration to become a web developer and learn all the technical skills one would need.
During this training, it became clear that my talents lied with backend and I decided to pursue this track by diving into PHP and Node.JS.
You can find the two projects I worked on here on my Github profile.
The taste for more backend languages and frameworks has been acquired and I'm already looking forward to starting a journey towards software development.
